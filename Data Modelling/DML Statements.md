# `Data Manipulation Language`

(DML) statements are used to modify the contents of a table instead of its structure.

<br>

    The most important DML statements are as follows:

- `INSERT`: To insert records into a table
- `UPDATE`: To update the existing records of a table
- `DELETE`: To delete records from a table

-----------------

    Note the difference between the DROP and DELETE statements. 

While `DROP` is used to remove the contents as well as the metadata of a table, 

`DELETE` removes only the contents of the table. 

DML statements operate only on the contents of a table and not on its structure.

-----------------

- DDL statements are used to create, alter and drop tables.
- DELETE is the DML statement used for this operation.
- INSERT is the DML statement used for this operation.
- RENAME is the DDL statement used for this operation.
