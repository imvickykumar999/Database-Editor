# `Data Definition Language` 

(DDL) statements are an integral part of data modelling; 

you will use them extensively to create the structure of several entities in your database.

<br>

      Using DDL statements, you can specify the following:

- The table structure 
- The different columns that belong to a table
- The data type of each of those columns
- The relationship between multiple entities

----------------

    The most important DDL statements are as follows:

- `CREATE`: To create the table structure
- `ALTER`: To modify the table structure
- `DROP`: To remove the table structure
